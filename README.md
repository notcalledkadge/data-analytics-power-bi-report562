#Data Analytics Power BI Report.
##Milestone 2
###Task 2. Load and Transform the "Orders" Table.
The main focus of Milestone 2 was to import the necessary elements required to produce this report into Power BI, the first part of the puzzle was the "Orders" table. Described in the task as the 'main fact table', the process to import the Orders table was simple in that it was laid out for me. Using the provided server and database names to access the dummy Azure SQL Database via the "Get Data" and "SQL Server Database" options, I was able to import the Orders table directly into Power BI.
